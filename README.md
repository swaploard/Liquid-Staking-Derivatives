# üè¶ LSD-Collateralized Stablecoin Borrowing Protocol

A decentralized lending protocol that allows users to deposit liquid staking tokens (LSDs) such as **stETH**, **rETH**, and **bETH** as collateral to borrow **stablecoins** like DAI or USDC ‚Äî without sacrificing ETH staking rewards.

---

## üåü Key Features

- **LSD Collateral Support**  
  Deposit stETH, rETH, or bETH as overcollateralized assets.
  
- **Stablecoin Borrowing**  
  Borrow DAI or USDC up to 75% LTV against your LSD collateral.

- **Health Factor Tracking**  
  Real-time health factor monitoring with visual feedback to avoid liquidation.

- **Safe Withdrawals**  
  Users can only withdraw collateral that maintains health factor > 1.0.

- **Mock Price Oracles**  
  Simulated LSD-ETH price feeds on testnet for accurate borrowing dynamics.

- **Testnet Deployed**  
  Built for testing on Goerli or Holesky with mock tokens and contracts.
